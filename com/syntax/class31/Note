FileHandling:
    Reading/Writing data to a file is called file handling
Why FileHandling is important
    The data that changes frequently we don't put that data with code
    because if we have to change that data we need to recompile code
    and redeploy the code on production server again it's a very lengthy process and
    might take weeks. The other issue is we might accidentally change the code as well
    when changing the data and might introduce bugs
Why to handle file in Java:
    We follow below steps to read and write data to files
    1. We need to know the path of file
    2. Navigate to that location using FileInputStream if we are planning to read a
    data from a file and FileOutStream if we are planning to write the data from file
    3. Need to use the proper class that can handle that file for example if we need to
    read/write data from properties class we can use the Properties class and CSSFWorkBook
    class for Excel class
