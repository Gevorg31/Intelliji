Set Interface:
    Set in Java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets but we will only discuss
     the most widely used ones which are
     HashSet
     LinkedHashSet
     TreeSet
      HashSet:
Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data
     Insertion order is not maintained
     No get method to get a single value
LinkedHashSet:
    Insertion order is maintained
    Insertion speed is comparable to HashSet but the retrival speed is the slowest
TreeSet:
    THe data is stored in the sorted form
    Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than LinkedListSet but slower than HashSet

Mostly use to remove duplicates

==================================================================================================
Map:
    Allow to store key value pairs. First data is a key and second is value
    Keys can't be Duplicates but values can be
    Map<Integer,String> items = new HashMap<>();

1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    It is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data
    Insertion order is not maintained
LinkedHAshMap:
    Insertion order is maintained
    Insertion speed is lower than HashMap. Retrieval speed is slowest of all
TreeMap
    Data is stored in the sorted form always
    Insertion speed is very slow
