What is an interface:
    Interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields inside a class
    are public static final(constants) and all the method by default are also public
Why should we learn about interfaces:
    We can implement abstraction using interfaces
    When classes are logically connected to each other and we want to have instance
    fields and implemented methods as well while doing abstraction then we should
    go with abstract class
How can i use an interface:
    We use interface keyword instead of a class and we start creating abstract method
Rules:
    All the fields inside an interface are public static final
    No instance fields means no constructor is required
    No instance method in interface and all the methods vy default are abstract
    When we implement the methods from the interface we use the implements keyword
    Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in Java
    Interface can extend another interface
    Variables in interfaces can't be private, protected or default

Encapsulation in java:
    Encapsulation is a 4th pillar of OOPs
    Is a mechanism that provides us security. If we use encapsulation we can have more security
How we should use Encapsulation:
    Make your variables as private
    Create setter and getter methods to read and write this fields

Basic unit to store is a variable
it's easy to access the value by the variable name we don't need to concern about indexes
Problem with variables:
    1) They  can only store value at a time
    2) If we want to store more then one value using variables we have to create more variables.
Arrays:
    Arrays can hold multi[ple values in a single variable then use indexes to access those values
Upside of Arrays:
    1) Arrays are the fastest data structure when it comes to process the data
    2) Arrays occupy 4 times less memory than an arrayList

Problem with Array:
    1) They are fixed in size means once we have created an array we can't modify it's size
    2) No built-in methods in arrays like add, remove, findIndex etc
ArrayList:
add() -- we use it to add the element an arrayList
