Maps in java:
    Map is an interface in Java that allow us to store key and value pairs. Keys can't be duplicate
    but values can be.
    1) HashMap
    2) LinkedHAshMap
    3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    Upside: It's the fastest of all
    Downside: Doesn't maintain the insertion order
LinkedHAshMap:
    Upside: Order is maintained
    Downside: Retrieval speed is slow. Insertion speed is better than TreeMap but slower than HashMap
TreeMap:
    Upside: Data is always stored in the sorted form
    Downside: Insertion speed is slowest of all. Retrieval speed is slower than HashMap but faster than LinkedHashMap

Important Note:
We can use three methods to get the data from map
    1) EntrySet(): key, value store inside an object of type Map.Entry. We can use getKey method
    on this object to get the key of that entry and getValue method to get the value of that entry.
    2) KeySet(): it will return all keys from a map in the form of a set
    3) values(): it will return us all the values from a map in the form of collection

FileHandling in Java:
    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file manually
    1. Path/location of the file that we want to read/write
    2. We need to navigate to that file on
    3. We need to have a software installed on our computer to interact with that file

    We need to have below three things in order to read/write a file manually
    1. PAth of a file we can store inside of a String
    2. We can use the DileInputStream/FileOutputStream class to navigate to that folder
    3. We use a specific Java class that can handle that file type
